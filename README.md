western_union_meter
===================

I bought a lovely old Western Union line tester off eBay. And a $7 serial Bluetooth Arduino module (also off eBay). And they fell in love!

The code to make them do so is incredibly simple and dumb, though, and probably isn't going to be of interest to anyone. It's so dumb, in fact, that I started with an Arduino IDE example sketch *and then had to take stuff out*. So, really: pretty dumb.

But eventually maybe I'll add some Python that does something interesting.
